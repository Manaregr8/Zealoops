    <h5>Shipping Policy</h5>
    <p>
        The customer is responsible for ensuring that the delivery address
        provided is accurate and valid. In cases of re-delivery or non-delivery,
        any additional costs incurred will be borne by the customer. ZEALOOPS
        will not be held accountable for any damages or losses resulting from
        mismanagement by third-party delivery service providers during transit.
        If ZEALOOPS is unable to deliver ordered products for any reason, the
        customer will be refunded via the same online payment method used for
        the purchase, or credited with a deposit to their account within 7
        business. <br /><br />When placing an order on the Website, customers
        are required to provide a valid phone number and email address. By
        providing this information, customers consent to be contacted by
        ZEALOOPS via phone calls and SMS alerts regarding purchases, shipments,
        or delivery updates. Unless explicitly objected to by the user, ZEALOOPS
        may utilize personal information for promotional phone calls or SMS
        messages.

    <h5>Refund & Cancellation</h5>
    <p>
        Our utmost priority is ensuring total customer satisfaction. If you are
        dissatisfied with our services, we will refund your money according to
        our refund policy, provided that the reasons are genuine and
        substantiated after a thorough investigation by our dedicated teams. Our
        policy regarding cancellation and refunds is outlined as follows:
    </p>
    <h5>Cancellation Policy</h5>
    <p>
        You have the option to cancel your order within 24 hours of placing it.
        However, if you choose to cancel after the product status has changed to
        'shipped' or 'out for delivery’, the company reserves the right to
        impose a 'cancellation fee' before processing the refund for your order.
    </p>
    <h5>Return Policy</h5>
    <p>
        Once the product/s has been delivered, returns or cancellations are not
        accepted, and no refunds will be issued. The product/s are shipped at
        the risk of the client/customer, and we are not responsible for any
        damages that may occur during transport.
    </p>
    <h5>Refund Policy</h5>
    <p>
        In the event of cancellation, clients/customers are responsible for
        covering the cancellation fee. Refunds will be processed to the original
        source account provided during purchase, after deducting the
        cancellation fee. Once the refund is initiated by us, it is anticipated
        to appear in the customer’s source account within 7 to 15 business days,
        in accordance with the regulations set forth by the Reserve Bank of
        India (RBI).
    </p>
    <h5>The cancellation fee is as follows:-</h5>
    <p>
        Within the initial 24 hours of order placement, no cancellation fee will
        be applied if the order has not been processed for dispatch. However, if
        the order status indicates it has been shipped, a cancellation fee
        equivalent to 10% of the total order value will be applicable. If the
        order status reflects "out for delivery," a cancellation fee of 30% of
        the total order value will be incurred.
    </p>
    <h5>CONFIDENTIALITY (Privacy Policy)</h5>
    <p>
        The information gathered from the User will be treated as confidential
        and will not be disclosed to third parties. However, the website retains
        the right to share basic details of this confidential information for
        promotional purposes related to both the User and the Website's
        business. Confidential information will only be disclosed to Law
        Enforcement Agencies in accordance with proper procedures. Additionally,
        confidential information may be shared if necessary for launching on
        other platforms such as IOS, Android, Google, Microsoft, etc.
